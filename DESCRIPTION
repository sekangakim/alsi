Description: Provides stability-validated methods for quantifying individual 
    differences in multivariate profile differentiation. Includes ALSI for 
    categorical/binary data via Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) and 
    cALSI for continuous data via ipsatized Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). 
    Both variants implement a three-stage validation pipeline: parallel analysis, 
    Procrustes principal angles, and Tucker's congruence coefficients to ensure 
    person-level indices reflect replicable latent structure.
