Description: Provides methods for computing profile differentiation indices 
    from multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) for binary categorical data 
    and singular value decomposition (SVD) for continuous data. The package 
    implements the Aggregated Latent Space Index (ALSI) for binary data 
    (Kim, 2025) and the Continuous ALSI (cALSI) for continuous data. 
    Both methods include bootstrap-based stability validation using 
    principal angles and Tucker's congruence coefficients.
