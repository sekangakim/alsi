Description: Tools for stability-validated aggregation in multiple correspondence 
    analysis (MCA). Implements parallel analysis for dimensionality assessment, 
    bootstrap-based subspace stability diagnostics using Procrustes rotation and 
    Tucker's congruence coefficients, and computation of the Aggregated Latent Space 
    Index (ALSI). ALSI is a person-level summary measure derived from validated MCA 
    dimensions that quantifies departure from independence along stable association 
    directions in multivariate categorical data.
