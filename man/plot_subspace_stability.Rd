\usage{
plot_subspace_stability(boot_obj)

plot_subspace_stability(boot_obj)
}
\arguments{
\item{boot_obj}{Object of class \code{mca_bootstrap}}
}
\value{
No return value, called for side effects. The function creates 
  a two-panel figure with: (1) boxplots of principal angles (left panel), 
  showing the distribution of subspace similarity across bootstrap resamples 
  for each dimension; and (2) boxplots of Tucker congruence coefficients 
  (right panel), showing dimension-level replicability with reference lines 
  at phi = 0.85 (good) and phi = 0.95 (excellent).
}
\description{
Creates diagnostic plots showing distributions of principal angles
and Tucker congruence coefficients across bootstrap resamples.
